# Kais≈ç Example

This is an example implementation of our [Kaiso](https://github.com/TomodomoCo/kaiso) library, which enables using controllers and dependency injection in WordPress.

This example also includes Twig templating.

Files of note:

+ `app/controllers/`: controllers (CamelCased versions of the templates in the hierarchy, with Controller appended. You could also have "PageController", "CategoryController", "Page[Slug]Controller", "Taxonomy[TaxonomySlug]Controller", etc.)
+ `app/views/`: Twig view files (These are named to correspond with the controllers, but definitely don't need to be!)
+ `public/content/themes/kaiso-theme/`: the theme that starts the whole operation (`index.php` is where the Kaiso app is set up and run.)

For more information on Kaiso, [visit its repo](https://github.com/TomodomoCo/kaiso).
